# WEEK 1 
## Introduction at InMachines Ingrassia GmbH
The internship started with a tour of the company that included a briefing on each station and machines present with their respective functions. A presentation was given to provide an overview of the company's projects and ongoing work which was followed by everyone’s introduction. 

## Familiarizing with 3D Printers & Assembly
The first task was assembling a Prusa Slicer Mini+ 3D printer, for which we researched the printer and its components to know how it operates. The assembly process took around 4-5 hours with the help of the instruction manual. Once the assembly was complete, we familiarized ourselves with the printer and ran some self-tests to check for any errors. Prusa Slicer software was downloaded on the computer, and a test model was designed on SOLIDWORKS for 3D printing. It was unsuccessful due to a calibration error caused by an offset in the nozzle head from the metal sheet. The height of the nozzle was readjusted, and it printed successfully.

## 3D Printing!
The next task was to 3D print an air fan adapter, and the Prusa Slicer settings were configured for faster printing. It took around 10 hours to print the component. This component is part of a fan for laser cutting machines which is to be sold.

## Air fan & Air compressor
The next task was replacing an accessory of an air compressor for which the vernier calipers was used to measure the drill size to screws of appropriate size. The accessory was custom 3D printed to fit and use in the laboratory of the company. This task was performed for four air compressor machines. Following this, we fixed the legs of the air fan to its body for four machines.

## Repairing AnyCubic Predator
We were then assigned to repair a 3D printer that had a shifting error while printing. Upon analysis, it was concluded that one out of four stepper motors was not functioning as intended. This was figured out using a multimeter to check the resistance at different pinouts of the motor. As the required motor was not stocked up in the inventory, this task was halted and proceeded to the next one.

## Wirings of Fabulaser 

We were briefed by our colleague on different types of cables and the process of crimping and fixing connectors to complete preparing the cables required for a laser cutting machine that is to be shipped to customers. In this process, wires were cut of required dimensions for different functions such as window sensor cable, stepper motor cable, driver power cable, etc. To provide more insight on this task, for the motor cable, the insulation was removed from a 4-core cable of a certain length and soldered to another such cable and fixed a connector to its end. I was already familiar with soldering as I worked on soldering PCBs at the university, hence it was a smooth process.

A list of cables that were to be prepared for the laser-cutting machine was provided and continued working on this task. In addition to what was learned the previous day, we were taught how to use shrinking tubes on wires that are sensitive to electric noise. For this task, we were continuously looking into the wirings inside the actual laser cutting machine in the laboratory for a better understanding of the connections and the layout.

### HSRW Learnings
After assembling Prusa slicer, we used our knowledge of SOLIDWORKS learnt during the university to model a simple part for testing the printer. 

It was easy to initiate the repairing of Anycubic Predator as we already gained basic knowledge of stepper motors in the university and used these motors as well as multimeters in HSRW’s labs specifically for the course Sensors, Actuators & Networks, so we were able to apply what we learned to identify the faulty motor.


While preparing the wires for the laser cutting machine, we dealt with tasks that required soldering as well. Having some experience in soldering from the university for the laboratories of the electrical courses, it came very handy while performing the task.
