#WEEK 6

## Motor Driver CL57T & Bill Of Materials

This week began with the design of a specific stepper motor driver by referring to its datasheet on Fusion 360. Using vernier calipers, the dimensions of the motor were also measured to cross-check with the datasheet. After completing the design, the next task was carried out: installing the Property++ extension on Fusion 360, which helped export the Bill of Materials to Excel for three CNC machines.

The BOM from Excel was edited to the desired format and moved to Google Sheets.

## Laser Duo Machine

The next agenda was to design masks for drilling holes on aluminum pieces for an assembly kit. Various sketches for different profiles were created on Fusion 360 and saved as a DXF file. These files were then carefully aligned on VisiCut so that all the pieces fit on a polypropylene sheet. The laser code was then exported to UGS and cut on Laser Duo.

## Heavy Duty Drill Machine

The laser-cut masks were placed on the required aluminum slabs to drill holes on them. We first used a center press to mark the centers and then placed the slabs on the machine. The drill bits were inserted, and upon proper placement, we began drilling.

## Charging CCTVs

We removed all the CCTVs in and around the company to recharge their batteries. Upon charging, we fixed them back to their positions.

## Disassembly of Machine Vice

The next task involved disassembling and repairing a CNC machine vice to straighten a bent rod. We also cleaned and removed rust from the vice using lubricants.

## Machine Assembly

Our goal was to carefully assemble a Fabulaser Mini, a small laser cutting machine. An assembly kit was prepared beforehand, in which all screws and materials were provided. At the end of this task, we had to report all errors and problems during the building of the machine and if any component was missing from the kit. The 3D model of this machine on Fusion 360 was studied and referred to during the entire process. It took us two days to build the machine.
