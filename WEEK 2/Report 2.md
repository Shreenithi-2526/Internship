# WEEK 2
## Repairing AnyCubic Predator

Started off the week with an extension of one of the previous tasks which was to fix eight air fan adapters to four fans using silicone adhesion, with the goal of securing them to laser-cutting machines for customers.

Next, we moved on to repairing an Anycubic Predator 3D printer. This involved removing all connections from the stepper motor of the extruder from the device as it was faulty and replacing it. However, this proved to be a challenging task as it took time to align and assemble all components precisely. After completing the repairs, the printer was tested by following the instruction manual and performing auto calibration testing using a nozzle height sensor. Unfortunately, the filament was not getting loaded as the motor was not rotating as expected and was generating a lot of heat, possibly due to incorrect wiring of the coil connected to the pinouts of the motor.

## Inspection of Stepper motor wiring
The next day started with a thorough inspection of the wires and connections of both the old and new stepper motor using a multimeter and cross-checking the data sheets for accurate information. The new wiring provided with the new motor didn't work, so we fixed the old wiring and ran tests which proved successful.

 To ensure the motor was working correctly, we removed the covering of the gear and filament and confirmed that it was turning clockwise and anti-clockwise while feeding the filament. Calibration tests were then carried out, but the leveling sensor got stuck on the printer bed.

## Replacement the nozzle
 Upon investigation, we found that the nozzle was leaking filament due to improper assembly and a lot of debris had accumulated near it. We replaced the nozzle with a new one, and upon receiving the file of the model to be printed, we set up the printer and its properties on CURA and generated the G-code file to run on the printer.

## Successfully Repaired AnyCubic Predator
We then performed the probing and calibration tests which proved to be successful and we printed 3D Model as well.Following this, we began printing the air fan adapter but noticed that the nozzle was positioned too close to the bed, so we made fine adjustments.

 Afterwards, we shifted our focus towards learning about the documentation process. For this, Visual studio code was installed along with the markdown extension. We navigated through the syntax and documented the report. Following this, we were helping in organizing an event that was set to take place the next day.

## Organizing of Event
I helped in adjusting the bed of a large 3D printer with a colleague that was to be exhibited for the event.  The event was very successful, all the machines were displayed in a properly functioning state, and overall, it was a very good experience. I came to know how a CNC milling machine is operated.

## PCB Soldering
We had our weekly meeting in which we discuss all the tasks that we did during the week as well as the agendas for the following week. We were assigned to solder a PCB for an open-sourced CNC milling machine. For this, we were first trained by our colleague to understand the whole process. After the training, we were given the schematic of the board and by reading the schematic, noted down the required components and their values, and soldered carefully.

## HSRW Learnings
This week, I really got to enhance my soldering skills. In the university, I did not gain experience in soldering SMD components. But here, we had to solder them by hand and through this process, we had to refine our hand skills. Further, since I was already familiar with soldering PCBs and with schematics of circuit diagrams from the course Practical Electronics, it was easy to understand the schematic, the polarity of LEDs and diodes.
