# WEEK 9

##  Inventory Management

We helped put all the things in order in the CNC machinery area and disposed profiles that could not be used anymore and stored other tools in the inventory.

## Working for CNC Milling Machine

We designed many masks that were required to drill holes. For this, the mask was made according to the dimensions of the profile and laser cut.  Following this, we also drilled the necessary holes using the drill press and tapped them using the tapping machine and the manual tapping tool.

To partially assemble pieces, some filing was also done to fit them perfectly.


## Fixing of Laser Duo

We visited a company called Insel along our CEO to fix a laser cutting machine. There were some issues in the motor of the machine, due to which it was not functioning properly. We firstly, removed all the cover panels to access the stepper motor and upon inspection found that the bearings present were worn out since the motor was quite old. To replace the motor, we un-screwed it along with the pulley placed on the motor and removed the tension from the belt attached to it. After, this we opened up the electronics section at the back of the machine to check for any short-circuits using the multimeter. There was no short and we concluded that only the stepper motor was faulty. After replacing the motor, we performed a series of calibration tests to focus the laser beam precisely.

## Research on Controllers & Hardware Architecture

We were assigned a new project which was to update the existing hardware architechture of the existing machines. The purpose of this is to be able to add new features like Automatic Tool change, sensors, or any custom commands for the machines. The present architecture consists of a controller which takes g-code files from the pc and converts it to signals which is understood by the motor driver to move the motors accordingly.

Our research initially consisted of what types controllers are avaliable in the market and what features would be suitable for this purpose.
