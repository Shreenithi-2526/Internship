# WEEK 8

## Air Gun Holder

We were given a task to design a holder for an air gun that is to be installed in a CNC Milling machine. We were provided a briefing about the requirements regarding the holder and keeping these in mind, we started designing on Fusion 360. 

We measured the dimensions using the vernier calipers of the machine for the handle and decided where to place it. The design was converted to an stl file and generated a G-Code file from Prusa Slicer Mini. 

The file was then 3D printed and we fixed it on the machine.

 But we decided to design another model to fix it at a different position.
The first version was fixed on the controller but it was'nt very convenient. 
So, another version was designed and re-printed.

## Laser Cutting

Four pieces of cubes made from Acrylic needed to be laser cut. The purpose of these cubes are to create alignment while milling parts for the small CNC machine.

## Crowd Funding

A  research was conduction about crowd-funding platforms and the requirements necessary to start a campaign. We did a comparison between several websites like indoegogo, kickstarter, crowd supply to determine the most suitable one for the company. 

## Machine Disassembly of Fabulaser Mini

After discussing with colleagues about the problems in the assembly kit, we disassembled the Fabulaser Mini laser cutting machine that was built in the previous weeks.and packed the assembly kit for a workshop in Tunisia.
