# Week 3

## Completion of PCBs

This week started with the continuation of finishing the soldering for the PCBs of the laser cutter and CNC milling machine. We were getting better and faster at soldering. We soldered the SMD resistors, capacitors, transistors and diodes, relays followed by various pin headers and finally the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. In total, 3 PCBs were almost ready, 2 for the CNC milling machine and one for the laser cutter. Since some components were not ready avaliable, we had to wait till it is in stock.

## BOM of Vinyl Cutter

We were assigned a new task. The goal was to provide Bill of materials (BOM) for the fastners and inserts used in an open sourced vinyl cutter. For this we first prepared the excel sheet and then started with disassembling the vinyl cutter to check for the required fasterns. After removing a screw, we measured it with a Vernier Calipers and also searched for the standardization of the screw. We did this for a total of 69 fastners along with 29 inserts. By the end of this process, we were also able to understand the machine parts and its usage.

## Laser DUO 

We were trained by our colleague on how to operate the Laser DUO to cut out masks from a material called MDF. For this we were first provided with the safety instructions and how to turn on/off the machine. A foot pedal was used to turn on/off the air compressor and the chiller which ensures that the the material does not catch fire and to cool down the laser tube respectively. Following this, we learned how to use the two softwares Visicut and UGS that is used while operating this machine. After a demo, we were given a task of laser cutting a piece whch was completed successfully.

## Cables for Fabulaser Mini

It was a continuation of the task from 2 weeks ago. The preparation of cables mostly involved steps such as: ripping of the insulation from a 2/3/4 core cable, crimping the ends to a connector, soldering some wires, organizing, packing and labeling the prepared cables to a box. For this task, we had to understand the wirings inside a Laser cutting machine and analyzed already existing connections inside a machine.

## Working on Fusion 360

We were trained in Fusion 360 and provided with a brief overview of all the necesassry functions. After this, we were to update an existing model of the Vinyl Cutter by adding specific type fastners that we had found while making its BOM previously. This task took the entire day as we were still getting familiar with the software and there were many fastners.

## HSRW Leanrnings

The course Engineering Drawing & Design came very handy as we had learned to use SOLIDWORKS in it. In the company, we use Fusion 360 and it was  easy to apply what we leanred in Solidworks to the new software.

In the group project, we gained exposure to BOM which gave me more clarity while doing BOM related tasks in the company.
